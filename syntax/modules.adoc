== Modules

toc::[]

Lapyst allows you to extend an shape through an third mean besides inheritance an re-entry: you also can simply 'include' code!
Lets have a look on how this works:

[source,lapyst]
----
module MyMod <1>
    def sayHello()
        printf("Hello world!");
    end
end

shape MyShape
    include MyMod; <2>
end

var s = new MyShape()
s.sayHello(); <3>
----
<1> The keyword `module` defines an module; here we name it `MyMod`.
<2> This 'includes' the module. It has as effect that all methods defined inside the module are now methods of the shape.
<3> Since we included `MyMod`, which defines `sayHello`, this call succeeds.

NOTE: modules cannot be instanciated, called static methods onto or otherwise be interacted with it's content. They only serve to be included in shapes.
