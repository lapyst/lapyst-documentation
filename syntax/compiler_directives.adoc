# Compiler directives

toc::[]

## Syntax

Compiler directives are written like so:

[source,lapyst]
----
{$define ABC 123} <1>
----
<1> Directives must always start and end on the same line.

## Goal

The goal of compiler directives is to switch options of the compiler for each file / translation unit.
For example, if you want to disable safety features or enable additional checks and so on.
