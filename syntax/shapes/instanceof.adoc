= The `instanceof` keyword

toc::[]

As we learned previous, with the `shapeof` keyword can we get the current shape of an instance. However, if we want to check if an instance is an descendant from an shape X, we would need to write some longer code.

This is why lapyst also has the `instanceof` keyword:

[source, lapyst]
----
shape Cat
end

shape Tiger use [Cat]
end

shape Dog
end

var Dog d = new Dog();
var Tiger t = new Tiger();

d instanceof Dog    // yield 'true', since 'd' is itself from shape 'Dog'

t instanceof Cat    // yield 'true' since 't' is from shape 'Tiger' which in turns has 'Cat' as a parent!
----

To only check if a instance is itself from a specific shape and ignoring any anchestors, you can use `instanceof!` instead:
[source,lapyst]
----
shape Cat
end

shape Tiger use [Cat]
end

var Tiger t = new Tiger();

t instanceof Cat    // yields 'true'

t instanceof! Cat   // yields 'false' since 't' is a 'Tiger'
