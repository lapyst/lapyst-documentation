With properties, you can 'disguise' methods as fields.

shape Person
    var string name; // field

    prop string !Name <1>
        def string get() <2>
            return self.name;
        end

        def set(string val) <3>
            self.name = val;
        end
    end
end

var Person p = new Person();
var string n = p.Name; <4>
p.Name = "..."; <5>
----
<1> Declares a new property named `Name` with the visibility public.
<2> Declares a getter function; must be named `get` as well as no parameters & returning the type the property is typed as.
<3> Declares a setter function; must be named `set` as well as no return type (or `void`) & a single parameter typed the same as the property.
<4> To call the getter, just use the property as you would use a field.
<5> To call the setter, just use the property as you would use a field.
