toc::[]

In Lapyst, you can group code by using namespaces. This allows you to tidy up your code some more.

[source,lapyst]
----
namespace MyCode
    def my_method()
        printf("Hello world!\n");
    end

    shape Test
    end
end

MyCode::my_method(); <1>

var t = new MyCode::Test(); <1>
----
<1> When refering to names inside an namespace, we must prefix this name with the name of the namespace and seperate (or join) the both names using a double colon (`::`).

IMPORTANT: A namespace is NOT a type and cannot be instanciated. You also dont need to use the `static` keyword on any function in an namespace like you would in an shape.

NOTE: A namespace can be re-opened at a later point to add new content to it. Note however that overwriting of previous defined elements  only works for methods.
