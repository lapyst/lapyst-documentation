= Comments

In lapyst, line comments can begin either with `//` or `#` and run until the line ends (LN / `\n`). There are also mutline comments available which starts with `/&#42;` and ends with `&#42;/`:

[source,lapyst]
----
// this is a line not processed by the parser
# this line too

/*
 And here we have an whole region of the file
 that's not processed!
*/
----

I personaly believe the first thing one should learn in a new language is how to write comments. This can help newcomers to document what code is doing, outcomment code to test things and much much more.

Lapyst also supports doc-comments; a special form of comments where the standard toolset of lapyst searches for more information it then can use for documentational purposes. For more of that see Doc-Comments.
