= Enum

toc::[]

An enum like an shape, but they cannot be instanciated like shapes. They have rather a well defined set of instances that are created at compile time. Lets look at an example:

[source,lapyst]
----
enum Planet
    Earth(6371.0), Mars(3389.5), Merkur(2439.7);

    var radius;

    def Planet(float radius)
        self.radius = radius;
    end

    def getRadius()
        return self.radius;
    end
end

var Planet p0 = new Planet(12); # this dosnt work

var Planet p1 = Planet::Earth;  # this works
----

As displayed above, your enum `Planet` cannot be instanciated with the `new` keyword. We rather need to use the syntax we normaly use for namespaces to use the well-defined instance `Earth`.

NOTE: Enums make it very easy to implement the singleton pattern.
