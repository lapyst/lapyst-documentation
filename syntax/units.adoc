= Units

toc::[]

Each lapyst sourcefile is called "unit". Units help you to structure your code and split it over multiple files. Each unit needs to be declared and given a name, for example:

[source,lapyst,website=norun]
----
unit test;
----

[source,lapyst,website=norun]
----
unit test::sub_unit;
----

IMPORTANT: unit names need to be the first thing in a file other than comments!
